VNC - it is directly connection to VPS. If neither Teamviewer nor Anydesk don't work, you can connect via VNC - VNC always works!
For connect via VNC use "VNC Viewer"

Your payment day is 12 MAY.

If you do not want to lose access to VPS I recommend RENEW your VPS in advance -  ideally 3-4 days before the expiry date.
The fastest RENEW way - Personal Account on the site: https://trustvs.com/dashboard
Make sure that you see your vps in the account.

Also, change at least main user password! -> It is IMPORTANT!!!  or you can be easy hacked and your VPS will be blocked!

Thank you for your order!
